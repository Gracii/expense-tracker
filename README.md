## Summary

This app is a simple expense tracker. It lets you record your expenses similar to a checkbook register (by type i.e. cash, date, amount $ & including a description), but has separate columns for different categories for recording your transaction. Built with simple CSS styling. It was fun creating functions to Dynamically Add or Remove Table Rows in Vanilla JavaScript.
